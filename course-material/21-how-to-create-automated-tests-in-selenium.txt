Creating Automated Tests
 
There are three steps to executing a web test:
* Find the element on the web browser
* Perform an action on the found element(s)
* Test and create a test report with the results
    * Find element, Perform action, Test & Report
 
Find textbox
Type email ID
Test if login is successful and report
 
Finding Elements in Selenium
 
An element can be found on a web page using the following selectors:
* ID
* Name
* Class Name
* Tag Name
* Link Text
* Partial Link Text
* XPATH
 
Syntax: WebElement button = driver.findElement(By.class("CwaK9"));
 
Performing Action on Elements
 
The next step is taking an action. For that, one can try the following options:
* click(): Used to click on the link and wait for page load to complete before proceeding to the next command
* sendKeys(): Used to enter values onto text boxes
* clear(): Used to clear text boxes of its current  value
* submit(): WebDriver will automatically trigger the submit function of the form where that element belongs to
    * WebElement button = driver.findElement(By.class("CwaK9")).click();
